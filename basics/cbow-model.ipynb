philippine sugar production in the 1987 88 crop year ending august has been set at 1 6 mln tonnes up from a provisional 1 3 mln tonnes this year sugar regulatory administration sra chairman arsenio yulo said yulo told reuters a survey during the current milling season which ends next month showed the 1986 87 estimate would almost certainly be met he said at least 1 2 mln tonnes of the 1987 88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption yulo said about 130 000 tonnes would be set aside for the u s sugar quota 150 000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50 000 tonnes would be sold on the world market he said if the government approved a long standing sra recommendation to manufacture ethanol the project would take up another 150 000 tonnes slightly raising the target the government for its own reasons has been delaying approval of the project but we expect it to come through by july yulo said ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos yulo said three major philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved the ethanol project would result in employment for about 100 000 people sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry production quotas set for the first time in 1987 88 had been submitted to president corazon aquino i think the president would rather wait till the new congress convenes after the may elections he said but there is really no need for such quotas we are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level the producers have never enjoyed such high prices yulo said adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul up from 190 pesos last august yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the sra's bid to control production we are no longer concerned so much with the world market he said adding producers in the negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production he said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry the brazilians long ago learnt their lessons yulo said they have 300 sugar mills compared with our 41 but they relocated many of them and diversified production we want to call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry he said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock used for thatching roofs or used in room panelling when you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce sugar he said yulo said the philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the international sugar agreement which expired in 1984 as a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices yulo said if there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed particularly because the european community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets he said current world prices holding steady at about 7 60 cents per pound were uneconomical for the philippines where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound if the price holds steady for a while at 7 60 cents i expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year he said yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990 with world consumption outstripping production he said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup but we are not happy with the reagan administration he said since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the u s in 1982 when they restored the quota system they cut ours in half without any justification manila was keenly watching washington's moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents the u s agriculture department last december slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the philippines to 143 780 short tons from 231 660 short tons in 1986 yulo said despite next year's increased production target some philippine mills were expected to shut down at least four of the 41 mills were not working during the 1986 87 season he said we expect two or three more to follow suit during the next season reuter 3 ? the agriculture department's widening of louisiana gulf differentials will affect county posted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states a usda official said all counties in iowa will be affected as will counties which use the gulf to price corn in illinois indiana tennessee kentucky missouri mississippi arkansas alabama and louisiana said ron burgess deputy director of commodity operations division for the usda usda last night notified the grain industry that effective immediately all gulf differentials used to price interior corn would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts depending on what the differential is usda's action was taken to lower excessively high posted county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices we've been following this louisiana gulf situation for a month and we don't think it's going to get back in line in any nearby time burgess said burgess said usda will probably narrow back the gulf differentials when and if gulf prices recede if we're off the mark now because we're too high wouldn't we be as much off the mark if we're too low he said while forecasting more adjustments if gulf prices fall burgess said no other changes in usda's price system are being planned right now we don't tinker we don't make changes lightly and we don't make changes often he said reuter 3 ?

strong south easterly winds were keeping many vessels trapped in the ice off the finnish and swedish coasts in one of the worst icy periods in the baltic for many years the finnish board of navigation said in finland and sweden up to 50 vessels were reported to be stuck in the ice and even the largest of the assisting icebreakers were having difficulties in breaking through to the stranded ships coastguard officials said however icy conditions in the southern baltic at the soviet oil ports of ventspils and klaipeda had eased they said weather officials in neighbouring sweden said the icy conditions in the baltic were the worst for 30 years with ships fighting a losing battle to keep moving in the coastal stretches of the gulf of bothnia which divides finland and sweden the ice is up to one metre thick with drifts and currents packing it into almost impenetrable walls three metres high swedish coastguard officials said weather forecasts say winds may ease during the weekend but a further drop in temperature could bring shipping to a standstill the officials said reuter 3\n",
