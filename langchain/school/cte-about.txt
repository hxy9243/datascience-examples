Career and Technical Education provides students with the academic knowledge and technical skills they need to gain entry to high-skill, high-wage, and high-demand industries. CTE provides work-based learning experiences that combine hands-on learning with real-world scenarios so students are prepared to enter the workforce or college after they graduate high school.

CTE courses are dynamic and engaging, giving students a platform to find their passion and make a career of it.  With options for earning college credit, industry credentials and postsecondary awards (like certifications and associate degrees) CTE helps all students prepare for college, career and life.

There are CTE national career clusters which guide students through a planned program of study. Admission to these courses is based on a student’s interest and aptitude as well as availability.

Instructors are a highlight of CTE —they are talented individuals who are experts in their area of study. Many CTE instructors continue to work in their field while they teach at Austin ISD, giving them the distinct advantage of staying up-to-date on trends and best practices.

Students in CTE programs experience vibrant learning in a focused plan of study, so when they graduate from AISD, they are skilled, knowledgeable and ready to succeed.
